# Egeria Semantics workgroup 23rd of April 2020

## Agenda:
* Michal to present proposal of model formats and mappings from RDF to Egeria to IGC  

## Attendees:
* David Radley (IBM)
* Mandy Chessell (IBM)
* Michal Miklas (IBM)
* Pat O'Sullivan (IBM)
* Chris Grote (IBM)
* Oana Turbatu (ING)
* Chris Replogle (SAS)

## Minutes:
* David presented the [Egeria parsing and archive work](../documents/Semantics%20call%2023rd%20of%20April.pptx) that allows the open standards based semantics models to imported into Egeria
* David showed a small model in Rex ( the Egeria repository explorer in the Egeria UI) and then an industry model.
* Michal showed his ideas around visualising a model
* In terms of visualisation feedback:
    * Michal suggested it would be good to filter prior to displaying graph content. An alternative approach would be 
    to display a lot of graph information and then allow the user to remove parts based on criteria they have specified.
    * Chris Grote talked of Rex not being a business focussed UI, and that a subject area business ui would only show business content 
    and could display smaller labels for relationships that might help take less real estate in the visualization.
    * We talked of colours and icons as a way of being able to easily see the different types of things on the screen. We
    suggested that icons would be preferable - but a customization user preference based pallet of colours or shapes might be useful.
    * We agreed David would proceed to put this code into Egeria as a tech preview.
    * Michal said he would look to see if he could supply smaller more meaningful glossaries that Egeria could ship.
